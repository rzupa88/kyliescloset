# KZ Closet

A kid-friendly closet + outfit planner app (monorepo).

## Monorepo layout
- `services/` - backend services (e.g., background removal)
- `web/` - front-end app
- `docs/` - architecture + decisions (ADRs)

## Documentation
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
- Decisions (ADRs): `docs/decisions/`

## Project approach
We ship in milestones with small PRs, frequent documentation, and clear acceptance criteria.
## CI
Pull requests run a basic CI workflow that checks repository hygiene (docs present, no trailing whitespace).
